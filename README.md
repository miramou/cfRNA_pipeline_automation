# Running cfRNA extraction from plasma pipeline using Opentrons and Bravo

## Overview:
* Opentrons runs all steps from start to finish. Now used pipeline multiple times to process real samples and works well
* Bravo operates library prep bead cleanups

## Notes:
* Plate based format appears to co-elute salt at inhibitory concentrations when processing plasma to allow for future RT using Takara kit. Fixing soon
* Moved away from Bravo during RNA extraction due to inadequate max volume
